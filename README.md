This project aimed to develop a model for predicting movie ratings in the Indian film industry using features like year, duration, votes, and the average ratings of genres, directors, and actors. The analysis involved data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and the application of a linear regression model.

The model demonstrated reasonably good predictive accuracy, explaining approximately 75% of the variance in movie ratings (R-squared = 0.75). This indicates that the selected features have a significant influence on movie ratings. Evaluation metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE = 0.51), Mean Squared Error (MSE = 0.46), and R-squared, further support the model's reliability in predicting ratings for new movies.

The model can reasonably predict Indian movie ratings using features like year, duration, votes, and average ratings of genres, directors, and actors, demonstrating moderate accuracy and reliability.
